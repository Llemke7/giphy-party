## **Part One: Solidify Terminology**

In your own terms, define the following terms:

- What is HTTP? a hypertext that is used to load web pages using hypertext
- What is a URL? an address to a location in the web
- What is DNS? DNS is used to connect web browsers to websites
- What is a query string? used to set parameters on information returned
- What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different? GET/POST get is used to call the information where post is used to submit data that is returned 
- What is an HTTP request? a message sent from a client to a server
- What is an HTTP response? a message sent from a server to a client based off the http request
- What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen. contains the meta data about the request/ response
- What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser? Browser checks cache for DNS records to find the IP address of the server.
Browser sends an HTTP request to the server.
Server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response.
Browser renders the received data (HTML, CSS, JS) to display the webpage.





Build a very simple HTML form that uses the GET method (it can use the same page URL for the action) when the form is submitted.  
<form action="#" method="GET">
    <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>


Edit the page to change the form type to POST, refresh in the browser and re-submit. Do you still see the field in the query string? Explore in Chrome how you can view the request and response headers, as well as the form data.
<form action="#" method="POST">
    <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </form>
